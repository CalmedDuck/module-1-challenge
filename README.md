# module-1-challenge
Challenge assignment for module 1.

## Description

This module challenge is to help me develop skills related to accessibility. I've had to refactor a lot of the code to make it more consolidated while stil retaining the same function. The webpage itself resembles a company named Horiseon and features various topics such as Search Engine Optimization, Online Reputation Management, and Social Media Marketing. See link for the screenshot.
